lets say you track what you eat and how much you eat and you make meals for 2 or sometimes 3 days.

For me, i cook 500 gr rice, 1 kg chicken for 2 days. I put those to different pods.

Each time, when it is time to eat, i use my mobile application written in kotlin by myself. App is not open to public and it is not worth sharing.

Normally this method was work fine for me until my brother (Yusuf) decided to get fit like me :P

So he started to come to my home to workout and eat certain amount of food that cooked by me. (he is gonna make it! totally believe in the guy)

I am going to make this app that stores on MongoDB. I plan to host it on Heroku.

Seems like i kinda give a lot of detail lol
